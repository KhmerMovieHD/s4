A few love to narrate stories.

4
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,544
A few love to listen to stories.

5
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:28,071
The story often undergoes change as
it passes from one individual to another.

6
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,336
I will narrate as my grandmother
passed it on to me.

7
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:35,328
And you can pass it on to your
granddaughter as you understand.

8
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:40,094
Likewise, people who died
doing good deeds...

9
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:43,904
are gradually identified
as great people and Titans...

10
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,938
and the stories of them
being worshipped as God spread all over.

11
00:02:47,578 --> 00:02:50,140
I'm going to narrate to you all
one such story.

12
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:55,195
It's the story of our ancestor
Ravanan's rebirth of the deity Koranar.

13
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:59,664
It's a 600-year-old story.

14
00:03:00,266 --> 00:03:02,610
During that time, King Ilavendhira
who ruled this land...

15
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,680
decided to build a temple for Shiva.

16
00:03:04,774 --> 00:03:08,805
And went on to ask our ancestor's help
who lived in Pothigai Hills.

17
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,235
And the ancestors agreed
to give up the land.

18
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,250
And finally arrived at Mathalamparai.

19
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,750
While they were digging
to lay the foundation...

20
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:17,305
they discovered a miraculous gemstone.

21
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:20,394
The news of the discovery
spread across eight districts.

22
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,946
The Kings from the neighbouring districts
started to show interest in the gemstone.

23
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:26,669
It took twenty years to build the temple.

24
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:28,750
During the period of construction...

25
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:31,882
two wars were fought to steal the Gemstone.

26
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,016
The King and the throne were in peril,

27
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,303
and so was our land.

28
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:42,225
But our ancestor Koranar saved it all
single-handedly with his life.

29
00:03:44,472 --> 00:03:47,045
Killed many enemies during the war

30
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,242
and sacrificed his life.

31
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,428
On witnessing the bravery
of our Ayya Koranar...

32
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,677
King Ilavendhira indebted
by his brave sacrifice...

33
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,640
...raised the Shivan Temple

34
00:03:56,914 --> 00:04:01,951
and the surrounding land deed
to the people of this village.

35
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,756
Our ancestors made a figurine of Koranar
with the Gemstone...

36
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:09,469
and gifted it to the King.

37
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:14,607
They say that the gemstone is still
hidden somewhere within the Kingdom.

38
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,630
Many made attempts to steal it.

39
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:17,803
But they failed!

40
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:23,326
[Sri Valli - Kaayatha Kanagathe song]

41
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:07,859
Are you feeling guilty
for giving up your comrade?

42
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,553
-Oh, God, no!
-He can't bear the beating!

43
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:57,115
Please, don't beat him.
Oh, God, no!

44
00:05:57,248 --> 00:05:59,193
Oh, God!

45
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:05,731
Please spare him, Ayya!

46
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,290
I don't know what to do!

47
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,786
Ayya, I don't know what to do.

48
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:28,876
Oh, no,
they beat you to death mercilessly.

49
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,096
Hurry up!

CAPTAIN MILLER

51
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,495
Three officers...

52
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,909
Fifty bullets...

53
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:49,226
Was it for killing an old man in his name?

54
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:53,428
Or for not adding Captain
as a prefix to his name?

55
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:56,938
I don't know.

56
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:08,433
Earlier, Miller was not outraged
by the Britishers.

57
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:17,742
Who do you think is responsible
for all the conflicts?

58
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:20,070
Is it Miller?

59
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,630
Or the Governor's son, Riley?

60
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,609
Or is it the King of this Kingdom,
Rajatthipathi?

61
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:27,086
Who is it?

62
00:12:01,547 --> 00:12:04,122
Kuyili mentioned that the Princess
was going to visit the temple.

63
00:12:04,382 --> 00:12:05,921
She is studying medicine in the city.

64
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:09,694
She mentioned that the Princess's glow
is shinier than the temple's.

65
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:15,945
Eesa, since I heard I wanted to
see the Princess at least once.

66
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:19,218
-If we go to the temple--
-They won't even let us in.

67
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:23,867
If Mother were alive,
she would've whacked you with a broom.

68
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:27,076
Who are they to stop us?
Why should we fear?

69
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:29,266
We are going to the temple today
and see the Princess.

The blood shot to my head.

104
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,810
The Princess was lovely.

105
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:54,951
To me, that girl was more
beautiful than the Princess.

106
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:56,693
Sounds like you're smitten by her.

107
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:58,974
Huh, so you are the infamous thieves.

108
00:14:59,576 --> 00:15:01,388
They would've hung you both.

109
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:04,599
Forget about it. Who is that girl?

110
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:07,669
Are you going to tell?
Or shall I reveal your secret?

111
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,965
-Tell me. Who is she?
-Velmathi.

112
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,972
She is King's niece.

113
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,646
She lost her parents during childhood.

114
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:20,496
The King and the Prince
raised her since then.

115
00:15:21,145 --> 00:15:23,051
She studies in the same college
as the Princess.

116
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:27,685
Rumour has it that the King and
the Prince killed the girl's parents.

117
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,255
People say that the King has a mistress

118
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,302
and a son with her named Kandhiya.

119
00:15:33,701 --> 00:15:35,839
Who was born to whom?

120
00:15:36,138 --> 00:15:38,113
There is confusion when it comes
to King's family.

121
00:15:40,866 --> 00:15:42,670
I don't care a damn about it.

122
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,067
The girl who held my hand
despite knowing who we are...

123
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,776
and saved my life is the most beautiful.

124
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:50,848
As you were near the exit,
she held your hand.

125
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:52,990
If I were near the exit,
she would've held my hand.

126
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:55,230
You were not. So, shut up!

127
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,911
Beat him! Skin him alive!

128
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,590
-How dare you enter the temple?
-Ayya, please don't beat me!

129
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:05,785
Please don't beat me.

130
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:07,800
Who gave you the right to beat us?

131
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,677
Beat him, too!

132
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,964
Tell me, would it be blasphemy
if our people entered the temple?

133
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:15,135
You slave the people who built the temple
and make them stand guard.

134
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,784
But you enter the temple!

135
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:18,206
Stomp him!

136
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,870
Following faith is not an issue.

137
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:24,017
But when the faith impacts our lives,
it becomes a problem.

138
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,800
-Go!
-Please don't beat us.

139
00:16:25,862 --> 00:16:27,933
Please don't beat us.

140
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,245
I'll kill you!

141
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:33,024
Velmathi?

142
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:34,518
Velmathi?

143
00:16:35,524 --> 00:16:36,759
Please stop.

144
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,033
This is irrelevant to you.

145
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:43,346
Come!

146
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:49,165
Have you decided
to go against your uncle?

147
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:52,420
It was my mistake.
I should get the beatings, too.

148
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:53,790
Why are they only beating them?

149
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:55,446
Don't act too smart.

150
00:16:56,213 --> 00:16:57,767
If Shakunthala was not present here...

151
00:16:57,869 --> 00:17:00,033
you would not have lived
to see the daylight.

152
00:17:00,713 --> 00:17:03,816
But if you repeat this nonsense again.

153
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,011
None of us can save you.

154
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,384
Be within your limits.

155
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:17,612
Don't you feel it's wrong to prevent the
village folks from entering the temple?

156
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:20,034
Aren't you dearest to your father?

157
00:17:20,596 --> 00:17:21,463
Why don't you question him?

158
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,630
What do you want me to ask?

159
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:28,348
Velmathi, will it make a difference
if I question my father?

160
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:29,979
Get this into your head.

161
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:32,448
Lower caste, upper caste,
palace, and a hut.

162
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:34,770
Everywhere women are considered slaves.

163
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,911
As women, we are subservient.

164
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:39,956
If we want our voices heard...

165
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:41,109
we must be in power.

166
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,370
What happened, Eesa?

167
00:18:04,447 --> 00:18:05,829
You say that you want to join the military.

168
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:07,462
But now you're making a wrong move.

169
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,854
You would've died for entering
the temple yesterday.

170
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,082
You better remember it.

171
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:17,033
Listen, I'll go inside and then ask her.

172
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:19,995
If she nods yes I won't join the military.

173
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:21,532
Okay?

174
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:24,348
Why are you anxious for no reason?

175
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:26,667
You carry on, Eesa. Ignore her.

176
00:18:28,196 --> 00:18:30,597
Since Pechiamma is not there,
you don't fear anymore.

177
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:38,612
Velmathi!

178
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,104
Velmathi!

179
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,800
Velmathi, please hear me out.

180
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:45,093
Stop and hear me out once.

181
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,103
Think about it and then make a decision.

182
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:48,514
Why are you in a hurry?

183
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,095
Fine, let me talk to my father
and my brother.

184
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,275
I have made my decision.

185
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:58,956
You, too, leave.

186
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:00,976
Go back to Madras.

187
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,188
Think hard and then make a decision.

188
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,970
You go!

189
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:07,290
Stay right here. I'll be back.

190
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:08,517
Stay right here. Don't go anywhere.

191
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:10,884
-Shakuntala!
-You wait. I'll be back.

192
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,218
My Lord...

193
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:26,741
We have information from Kanagasabai
that young Princess is eloping.

194
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,858
He's going out personally to look for her.

195
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:32,772
Wait!

196
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:37,497
We have a reason to kill her now.

197
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:41,851
If Shakunthala is here,
she won't let us do anything.

198
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:44,625
Send her back to Madras.

199
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:48,212
You can't go past us.

200
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:51,835
Hey, who are you? Hey!

201
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:54,638
Oh, no! Spare me!
I have a family to look after.

202
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:55,746
I'm innocent.

203
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,033
-Let's go. Come on!
-Hey!

204
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,508
Go away.

205
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:21,699
You're Velmathi, right?

206
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:23,668
Why is everyone chasing you?

207
00:21:27,636 --> 00:21:28,580
Do you remember me?

208
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:30,284
The other day, I was at the temple.

209
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:31,566
You too held my hand--

210
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:34,111
-Hey!
-Who are you?

211
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,355
He saved me.

212
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:38,815
You know him?

213
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,975
Thank you, Comrade!

214
00:21:43,824 --> 00:21:47,441
Velmathi, you'll be in danger
if you come with me.

215
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:52,928
My organization and I...

216
00:21:53,426 --> 00:21:55,082
will make sure no harm befalls you.

217
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:56,395
Let's go!

218
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,418
Let's go, Velmathi.
Thank you, Comrade!

219
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,223
Thank you!

220
00:22:21,876 --> 00:22:24,274
You've been living underground
in the name of revolution.

221
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:26,063
Your mother passed away, too.

222
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,328
As it is they've been troubling
the village.

223
00:22:28,886 --> 00:22:31,898
Yesterday, he went inside the temple,
but Vanangamudi took the heat.

224
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,893
Now again, he went inside the temple.

225
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,759
Hold on, I'll talk to him.

226
00:22:44,642 --> 00:22:46,861
Eesa, what's wrong with you?

227
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,196
What are you doing?

228
00:22:53,729 --> 00:22:55,401
I'm joining the military, Sengannan.

229
00:22:57,378 --> 00:22:58,596
I was meaning to take it up.

230
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:00,589
Now I have made up my mind.

231
00:23:07,197 --> 00:23:10,244
I'm determined to chase away
the Britishers.

232
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,627
You're embarrassing me by
joining hands with them.

233
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:15,812
As it is, the village is cursing you.

234
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,033
-This is not right, Eesa.
-What is not right?

235
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,294
Please explain, Anna.

236
00:23:23,283 --> 00:23:24,649
Are you fighting for independence?

237
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:26,454
Whose independence?

238
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:30,658
You are going to get independence
from the Britishers...

239
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,814
and hand it over to the Kings
who oppress us.

240
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,564
The Kings prevent us from entering
the temple built by our ancestors.

241
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,149
And you're fighting for them.

242
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:41,086
It's not like before.

243
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,297
-Times have changed.
-There's no change!

244
00:23:43,343 --> 00:23:45,110
-Things will change here, too.
-I don't see any change.

245
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:48,729
Tell me!

246
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:51,316
Will they let us inside the temple?

247
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:54,634
Tell me, Sengannan..

248
00:23:55,722 --> 00:23:57,668
Will they let our people inside the temple?

249
00:24:00,304 --> 00:24:01,835
They treat us like feces.

250
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:05,221
Our kings prevent us from wearing sandals.

251
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:07,408
But in the military, the Britisher
gives me boots.

252
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:09,918
The Kings wants us to bow down to them.

253
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:12,315
But they let us eat along with them
as equals.

254
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:13,530
Our Kings oppress us!

255
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:16,395
But they respect me.
And that respect...

256
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,326
is my freedom!

257
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:22,024
If you want to fight for freedom,
go ahead. But I'm going.

258
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:23,656
If the Britishers are as good as you say,

259
00:24:24,306 --> 00:24:25,993
They came for business,
but now they rule us.

260
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,949
Oh, God. Did we have freedom
before they arrived?

261
00:24:31,713 --> 00:24:32,250
Huh?

262
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:34,814
Earlier the Kings ruled over us.

263
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,223
Now, the Britishers!

264
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:38,598
We were enslaved then and now.

265
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:39,895
How does it make a difference?

266
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,299
Hey, Eesa!

267
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,141
If Amma were alive,
she would not have let you go.

268
00:24:53,885 --> 00:24:55,799
It's best you don't bring Amma into this.

269
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:01,829
Even on her death bed,
she was chanting your name.

270
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:04,931
I wonder if she knew
if I was there or not.

271
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:07,379
Where were you then?

272
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:14,094
There's no one here...

273
00:25:17,454 --> 00:25:18,859
There's nothing here for me.

274
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,196
Amma is not here...

275
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:24,285
neither the people are there for me.

276
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,790
I don't see that you're there for me too.

277
00:25:32,689 --> 00:25:33,767
I'm going to join the military.

278
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:37,258
When we make a wrong decision in life...

279
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:39,610
we call it fate...

280
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,071
and blame it on the God.

281
00:25:43,283 --> 00:25:44,656
Is that God's decision?

282
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:46,641
Or is it our decision?

283
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:49,340
Tell me!

284
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:53,926
Why did you join the military?

285
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,250
For the country.

286
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,967
For the country, you say!

287
00:26:02,657 --> 00:26:03,813
-What's your name?
-Karruppusamy!

288
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:04,470
Number - 11

289
00:26:25,954 --> 00:26:27,040
Listen, everyone!

290
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:31,562
I stand before you...
Brothers in arms!

291
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,688
Every man in his first action is scared!

292
00:26:36,383 --> 00:26:39,896
If he says he's not...
He's a goddamn liar!

293
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,965
But the real hero...

294
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,733
...is the man who fights
even though he's scared.

295
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,708
Some men under fire...

296
00:26:49,027 --> 00:26:51,091
will get over their fright
in a minute.

297
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:52,718
Some take an hour.

298
00:26:53,224 --> 00:26:54,602
Some in days!

299
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,540
The real Hero never lets his
fear of death...

300
00:26:58,865 --> 00:26:59,982
overpower his honour...

301
00:27:00,396 --> 00:27:03,583
his sense of duty to his country
and to the King!

302
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:08,108
The future of the King's crown
lies in your hands.

303
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:09,771
God save the King!

304
00:27:10,826 --> 00:27:12,826
Time up! Time up! Time up! Time up!

305
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,051
Get up! Get up, boys!

306
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,573
Fast! Get ready!

307
00:27:18,254 --> 00:27:19,199
Get ready!

308
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:20,871
Form a line!

309
00:27:21,637 --> 00:27:22,551
Form a line!

310
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,555
[marching commands]

311
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:41,746
Time up! Time up! Time up! Time up!

312
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,394
Get up, boys!

313
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:44,528
Get up!

314
00:27:44,819 --> 00:27:46,374
Fast! Fast!

315
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,293
Get ready! Get ready boys!

316
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,551
Time up! Time up! Time up! Time up!

317
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:06,427
Get up, boys! Get ready!

318
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:08,845
[drill commands]

319
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,504
Kumaran!

320
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:31,182
-Next!
-Elangovan.

321
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:35,712
-Next!
-Kanagarathnam.

322
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:38,344
Annaleesan!

323
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:53,004
-Next!
-Nallathambi.

324
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,068
Miller! Go!

325
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,761
-Next!
-Maariappan.

326
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:07,823
Next!

327
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:13,511
You joined the military for the country.

328
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,783
But he joined the military for respect.

329
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:20,777
What name have they assigned you?

330
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,089
Miller!

331
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,957
Sepoy Miller!

332
00:29:32,082 --> 00:29:33,100
General Miller!

333
00:29:36,746 --> 00:29:37,925
Jawan Miller!

334
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:47,790
Captain Miller!

335
00:29:49,644 --> 00:29:50,386
Sounds good, right?

336
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:51,269
Captain?

337
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:53,374
You have long way to go, brother.

338
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:55,322
I don't mind how long it takes.

339
00:29:55,425 --> 00:29:57,511
-What is your name?
-Same name.

340
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:01,069
My father gave me it to me.
I won't change my name.

341
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:06,101
Tesph, Tea-bun...

342
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,178
-He said something like it.
-Sembatta, sir!

343
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,264
What name did they assign to you?

344
00:30:09,355 --> 00:30:11,316
They assigned me a name.
But I can't get it.

345
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,663
Could you read it to me
and explain what it is?

346
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,569
Let me see it.

347
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:17,154
Ste...

348
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,764
Stephen!

349
00:30:20,238 --> 00:30:22,798
Stephen, uh?
Damn, what kind of name is it?

350
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,263
They assign a name because
they can't pronounce our names.

351
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:27,858
But we can't pronounce the name
assigned to us.

352
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:30,840
-It is... Ste...
-...phen!

353
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,811
Stephen! Stephen!

354
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,885
Stephen... Stephen!

355
00:30:35,105 --> 00:30:36,136
-Hey, Sembatta.
-Hey!

356
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:38,160
What name did they assign you?

357
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,097
Ste... What was it?

358
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,311
-Stephen.
-Stephen!

359
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:46,769
How can a cow herder like you
have a name like Stephen?

360
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,084
Ignore him!

361
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,180
Hey, that name is beyond
your worthiness.

362
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,149
There are fanatics everywhere.

363
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:07,873
Captain Miller!

364
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:13,956
Eesa...

365
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:15,941
Aren't you writing a letter?

366
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:18,550
-To whom?
-Whom?

367
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:22,400
Mother, father, or your lover.

368
00:31:23,027 --> 00:31:24,753
My father died when I was born.

369
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,425
They killed my mother.

370
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:27,803
Eh... lover!

371
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:31,764
Before I could understand its love,
I lost it.

372
00:31:33,997 --> 00:31:36,611
Bloody sinners!
They killed your mother?

373
00:31:37,887 --> 00:31:39,215
Was it the Brits?

374
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,150
It was our people.

375
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,001
Even though I know who killed
my mother...

376
00:31:59,755 --> 00:32:03,251
I'm incapable and outraged
that I can't rip his guts out!

377
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:09,642
Like I ignore everything else...

378
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:11,923
I moved on bearing this angst.

379
00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:15,290
You write your letter.

380
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,556
You should be lucky
to have someone to write to.

381
00:32:20,153 --> 00:32:21,207
You have a point.

382
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:22,489
You bloody morons!

383
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:23,650
It's bedtime!

384
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,461
Get into the bed!

385
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:26,941
Idiots!

386
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:33,613
Decking up a goat ritually,

387
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:36,837
does the goat not realize all of it
is to butcher it?

388
00:32:40,144 --> 00:32:41,776
Hey, do you get it?

389
00:32:42,098 --> 00:32:43,728
He's calling you a scapegoat!

390
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:45,604
Not just one scapegoat...

391
00:32:46,113 --> 00:32:48,979
On that day, a herd of scapegoats
were marching ahead.

392
00:33:05,027 --> 00:33:06,251
Where are they taking us?

393
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:09,790
It does not feel right.

394
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:11,759
Stop with the nonsense.

395
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:13,751
Why are you afraid?

396
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:17,780
To warn or to arrest
the Police were enough.

397
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:19,563
Why do they need us?

398
00:33:22,223 --> 00:33:23,423
Don't talk nonsense.

399
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:26,314
It is our first assignment.
We need to do it diligently.

400
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:31,186
Look behind.
Sembatta a.k.a Stephen...

401
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,579
is walking with courage.

402
00:33:33,105 --> 00:33:33,761
Eesa...

403
00:33:39,238 --> 00:33:40,613
Bloody cowards!

404
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,184
Look at your face.

405
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,913
It's a shame we have weaklings
in our troop.

406
00:33:46,134 --> 00:33:48,053
A brave soldier won't be afraid
of anything

407
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,378
and will be firm when he's ordered to kill.

408
00:33:51,233 --> 00:33:53,538
A good soldier will follow
the Commander's orders!

409
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:58,764
But a brave warrior will only listen
to his heart.

410
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:01,663
Halt!

411
00:34:39,257 --> 00:34:42,882
[freedom fighters sloganeering]

412
00:35:13,748 --> 00:35:14,693
Take position!

413
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,839
I hope they won't ask us to shoot them.

414
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:56,319
FIRE!

415
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:08,842
FIRE!

416
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:19,985
I said bloody fire!

417
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,420
FIRE!

418
00:37:05,328 --> 00:37:07,034
Hey! Hey, Stephen!

419
00:37:30,494 --> 00:37:31,551
How could this be right?

420
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,140
How could this be right?

421
00:37:33,782 --> 00:37:35,609
He was distraught to kill his own people.

422
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,015
Miller's heart was stormed with emotions.

423
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:42,022
Amma...

424
00:37:42,518 --> 00:37:45,729
Eesa... Eesa...
Is this why they brought us here?

425
00:37:46,455 --> 00:37:50,588
Had I known we had to kill our people,
I would've never joined the military.

426
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:52,324
Oh, God!

427
00:37:53,573 --> 00:37:57,081
Eesa, you mentioned they killed
your mother.

428
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,696
Look behind. There are many mothers dead.

429
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:02,640
Rafi! Rafi!

430
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,487
An infant. An infant.

431
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:07,206
They've burned down infants.

432
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:08,534
Oh, God, no!

433
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,136
How am I going absolve my sins?

434
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:11,853
How am I going absolve my sins?

435
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,276
How am I going absolve my sins?

436
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:15,492
How am I going absolve my sins?

437
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:16,712
Amma!

438
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:17,574
Amma...

439
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:18,659
Amma?

440
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:21,057
Amma! Amma! Amma!

441
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:23,278
I did not-- Amma, I did not do it.

442
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,521
Amma, this is their gun.

443
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,540
The Brits gave it to me.
It's not mine.

444
00:38:27,954 --> 00:38:28,555
Amma?

445
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,363
Please don't give me that look.

446
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:33,279
Amma, please don't give me that look.

447
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,461
I did not do it.

448
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:36,043
I have blood on my hands.

449
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:37,996
It can be washed away
only with my blood.

450
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:40,547
I'll wipe the blood off my hands.

451
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:42,475
I'll wipe the blood off my hands, Amma.

452
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,312
I will wipe the blood off my hands.

453
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,816
I will wipe the blood off my hands.

454
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:48,495
I'll wipe the blood off my hands, Amma.

455
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,498
I'll wipe the blood off--

456
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:01,615
Stephen!

457
00:39:02,166 --> 00:39:03,896
Stephen, what happened?

458
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,295
Stephen! Stephen!

459
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:07,910
Stephen!

460
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:09,456
Sembatta!

461
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,688
What a waste!

462
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,098
Burn him with the rest of the bodies!

463
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,702
We don't have time.

464
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,618
Get back to wor--

465
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,636
Are you going to die?

466
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:14,660
Do you want to die, too?

467
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:16,639
Enough lives are lost!

468
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:18,982
Go away, Eesa!

469
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,162
Go away, Eesa!

470
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:24,527
If you stay back you'll be in trouble.

471
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:25,964
Go away!

472
00:40:26,315 --> 00:40:27,728
You go away, Eesa. Go!

473
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:34,149
Where will he go?

474
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:37,947
His only family is his brother, Sengolan.

475
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,985
He went looking for him.

476
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:41,421
He did go!

477
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:43,640
Why did you come here?

478
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:45,716
Are you here to kill us too?

479
00:40:45,778 --> 00:40:47,155
Hey, what's wrong with you?

480
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,693
The 300 freedom fighters you shot dead...

481
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:56,262
One among them was your brother,
Sengolan, too.

482
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:01,282
Despite his warnings,
you went on to join the military.

483
00:41:02,304 --> 00:41:04,457
-You're a curse to this village.
-Oh, God!

484
00:41:04,822 --> 00:41:05,665
Don't come here.

485
00:41:05,983 --> 00:41:07,244
Go somewhere far and die.

486
00:41:08,721 --> 00:41:09,673
Bloody sinner!

487
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,081
You killed the only relation you had.

488
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:15,073
This village is not yours.
Neither are the people.

489
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:18,837
Leave this village and go somewhere
in oblivion.

490
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:22,120
Spare us and let us live in peace.

491
00:41:22,861 --> 00:41:23,470
Let's go!

492
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,587
Living with the guilt...

493
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:34,721
is the worst of tortures.

494
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:37,749
He killed innocent people.

495
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:40,410
He killed his brother.

496
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,897
He was alive...

497
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:49,013
But he roamed like a living corpse.

498
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,964
When did Miller join your gang?

499
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:03,576
Two years ago...

500
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,715
during the heist near Twin Mountains,
we got caught by the Rangers.

501
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:09,879
That's when I met him
for the first time.

502
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,364
Hey!

503
00:42:19,616 --> 00:42:21,076
Hey! Fall back!

504
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:25,949
Fall back!

505
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:27,756
Hey!

506
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,670
He's right there. Look to his right.

507
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:33,648
Look at him!

508
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:18,828
Sarathy, tightly fasten it.

509
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:19,634
It's going to be a long ride.

510
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:23,852
The eyes looking for Miller
will start looking for us, too.

511
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:25,775
Do you think it will work for us?

512
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:29,141
He has a point, Kannaiya!

513
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:31,533
Think about it
before you make the decision.

514
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:32,619
What should I think about?

515
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:36,069
You couldn't aim to shoot
at a 10-foot distance.

516
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:38,244
And I entrust you bunch
and carry out heists.

517
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,547
Did you watch him?

518
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,033
It must be more than 100 feet...

519
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,541
he shot him in the forehead.

520
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,228
He's ex-military!

521
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:47,703
We need men like him in our gang.

522
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:58,423
Looks like your gang does not
approve of me.

523
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:02,918
You killed a bad man.

524
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:04,841
You must be a good man.

525
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:10,114
One bad man can also kill
another bad man.

526
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:11,122

Mill... Miller!

That's my name.

533
00:45:23,897 --> 00:45:24,947
What's your brother's name?

-Jambulingam!

00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:49,352
They asked me to die...

571
00:47:54,123 --> 00:47:55,958

who died during the struggle
for independence.

608
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:52,146
We believed
the country we live in is ours.

609
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:54,654
Also, we believed we had rights over it.

-Over here. Watch out.

615
00:51:19,149 --> 00:51:21,079

616
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:24,428
-Careful.
-Lay him over here.

00:51:26,222 --> 00:51:27,175

618
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,334
Please come over to this side.

619
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,083
Then, who is this?

620
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,895
He's one of our gang members.

621
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:37,750
There's a bullet in his hip.

622
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:14,959
Yesterday...

623
00:52:19,277 --> 00:52:22,020
-Was it Velmathi?
-Do you know her?

624
00:52:38,577 --> 00:52:40,217
A dacoit in the eyes of Britishers.

625
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,700

00:52:43,216 --> 00:52:44,445

627
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,624
Who you are...

628
00:52:48,726 --> 00:52:51,575
And what you need from me
will decide who I am.

629
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:00,403
My name is Vincent Pillai.

630
00:53:01,295 --> 00:53:03,108
I'm a friend of your brother, Sengolan.

631
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:06,592
We protested many and schemed plenty.

632
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:09,350
But we parted our ways.

633
00:53:10,428 --> 00:53:11,876
He should not have died.

634
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:14,579
That was a non-violence movement.

635
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,469
It was not a movement
that involved weapons.

636
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:18,288
The 300 people you people shot dead...

637
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:20,422
not just your brother died in it...

638
00:53:21,022 --> 00:53:23,514
but Doctor Velmathi's husband died, too.

639
00:53:56,054 --> 00:53:58,968
I feel disgusted to have saved
my husband's killer...

640
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:09,703
Miller, please join our movement.

641
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,735
Not as a dacoit.

642
00:54:12,102 --> 00:54:12,907
But as a murderer!

643
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,397
We are going to rip off a vital branch.

644
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:17,868
We need your help with it.

645
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:25,273
He's like a double-barrel gun.

646
00:54:25,593 --> 00:54:27,567
He's not even aware of which barrel
will fire the shot.

647
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,100
We lost a lot of freedom fighters!

648
00:54:32,624 --> 00:54:34,842
I need the obedient tigers.

649
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,680
Also, I need barbarians
who can rip off the tree.

650
00:54:38,498 --> 00:54:40,381
I know who he will listen to.

651
00:54:40,882 --> 00:54:41,795
I shall take my leave.

652
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:43,258
One minute!

653
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:45,000
What is it?

654
00:54:49,398 --> 00:54:50,356
Do you know this gang?

655
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:57,499
What else did you notice?

656
00:55:00,178 --> 00:55:01,689
They don't use guns.

657
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:02,864
Only bow and arrows.

658
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,225
I'm aware of this gang.

659
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:07,608
What's your concern?

660
00:55:09,123 --> 00:55:10,453
They stepped into my territory...

661
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,820
and stole what I had schemed to steal.

662
00:55:14,108 --> 00:55:14,994
Warn them.

663
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:18,393
Okay, I'll make sure they don't stop
into your territory.

664
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:19,257
Okay?

665
00:55:20,032 --> 00:55:21,137
-I'll take my leave.
-Sure!

666
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,195
I was sitting and wondering for a while
whether to kill you.

667
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,327
I studied to save lives...

668
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,709
so I could not kill.

669
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,483
You could've killed me.

670
00:55:40,975 --> 00:55:42,997
You might've spared me some mercy.

671
00:55:44,326 --> 00:55:45,693
You have killed many.

672
00:55:46,883 --> 00:55:48,465
I need you to kill for the movement.

673
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:51,600
Governor's son Riley.

674
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,009
He has been destroying our people
by the day.

675
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:58,595
Our plan to kill him failed.

676
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,710
Vincent Pillai believes
you're the man for it.

677
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:07,507
You didn't hesitate to kill
over 300 people...

678
00:56:08,187 --> 00:56:09,835
another kill will be
a walk in the park.

679
00:56:11,959 --> 00:56:14,513
Listen, Riley must die!

680
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:18,718
Had I been a killer like you...

681
00:56:19,623 --> 00:56:20,998
I would've killed him myself.

682
00:56:23,138 --> 00:56:24,934
Perhaps not for the movement.
For me--

683
00:56:30,977 --> 00:56:32,101
I want him dead!

684
00:56:34,297 --> 00:56:35,984
Kill one more person...

685
00:56:37,172 --> 00:56:38,657
and absolve your sins!

686
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:43,711
We need a reply by tomorrow.

687
00:56:47,395 --> 00:56:49,246
Is fate laughing or crying?
I do not know

688
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:52,362
Is this state a crime,
or am I to be grateful?

689
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:55,802
I am consoling myself to act...

The King bows down to the Brits.

You're a cunning fox!

715
00:59:45,473 --> 00:59:48,150
You were with them all along
and gave up the secret.

716
01:00:01,286 --> 01:00:02,916
What an exquisite view!

717
01:00:04,106 --> 01:00:05,369
Yes indeed!

718
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,142
I simply cannot look away.

719
01:00:09,791 --> 01:00:10,845
Yes, Your Excellency.

720
01:00:12,294 --> 01:00:14,290
This land is originally ours.

721
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:17,736
But these tribes have occupied it.

722
01:00:17,911 --> 01:00:19,354
We are trying to retrieve it now.

723
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:25,549
The Governor is aware of your situation.

724
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:30,947
He has told me of this place.

725
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,619
But this is the first time I'm seeing it
with my own eyes.

726
01:00:35,784 --> 01:00:38,229
It is indeed the perfect setting...

727
01:00:38,332 --> 01:00:41,627
in which to construct
the Governor's new hunting estate.

728
01:00:42,591 --> 01:00:43,689
Yes, Your Excellency.

729
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,395
If they see me talking to you
they'll skin me alive.

730
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:53,837
-You go ahead.
-Fine, I'm going.

731
01:00:54,153 --> 01:00:55,713
He's going to get me caught.

732
01:01:06,685 --> 01:01:09,541
The sooner you can dispose
of these tribals, the better.

733
01:01:10,778 --> 01:01:11,481
Sure!

734
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:17,341
Excellent! In the car!

735
01:01:17,878 --> 01:01:18,818
Open the door.

736
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:22,574
For generations, we have been longing...

737
01:01:23,544 --> 01:01:26,333
to see our deity Koranar at least once.

738
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:27,310
Never happened!

739
01:01:27,895 --> 01:01:29,213
Now, they have taken it away.

740
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:33,768
My Lord, what about...

741
01:01:57,973 --> 01:02:01,662
Before Kandhiya gets a whiff of it.
We have to retrieve the statue.

742
01:02:04,378 --> 01:02:06,628
The dacoit in the village...

743
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:09,434
Miller... Eesa...

744
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:11,729
The maid who works in the Palace.

745
01:02:11,835 --> 01:02:13,752
It's a good name. Yes, it's Kuyili.

746
01:02:13,877 --> 01:02:16,322
Her brother and Eesa are friends.

747
01:02:17,205 --> 01:02:18,884
Ask her brother to meet me.

748
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:37,650
The Britishers entered our temple...

749
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,898
and took away our property.

750
01:02:44,276 --> 01:02:45,935
Tell me, where is Eesa?

751
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:50,010
Only he can retrieve it.

752
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:55,939
I will allow the village folks
to enter the temple.

753
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:02,227
But don't tell them yet.

754
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:07,033
Temple's property is our dignity.

755
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:12,494
I'm not doing this to capture Eesa.

756
01:03:15,495 --> 01:03:17,174
But to save our dignity.

757
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:20,057
We want Eesa!

758
01:03:26,588 --> 01:03:27,588
What happened to you?

759
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:30,503
You're not yourself.

760
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,579
You've changed a lot.

761
01:03:34,048 --> 01:03:36,201
I changed when the bullet hit me.

762
01:03:37,225 --> 01:03:38,696
I saw my death up close...

763
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:40,467
If I survived,
I planned to drop everything,

764
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:43,311
go to Ceylon, and start afresh.

765
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,089
Because the bullet hit...

766
01:03:47,144 --> 01:03:48,331
...or Vel hit you?

767
01:03:52,214 --> 01:03:54,120
On that night, I was sleepless.

768
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:57,439
I overheard your conversation
with Velmathi.

769
01:03:58,736 --> 01:04:00,157
Do you know her from before?

770
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:21,212
I'm asking this favour for the sake
of the village.

771
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,253
If Eesa does what we ask of

772
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:25,019
the village people can enter the temple.

773
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:30,179
Aren't you coming with me?

774
01:04:31,156 --> 01:04:33,818
Anna, Eesa won't do it
if he knows it's for the village.

775
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,992
If he sees me,
he will not agree to do it.

776
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,993
He will get angry.
I'll be right here.

777
01:04:38,477 --> 01:04:40,047
Please convince him to do it.

778
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:58,404
If not for Velmathi,
Ayyavoo and I would've been long dead.

779
01:05:00,306 --> 01:05:02,522
Even though it could put her in danger,
she helped us.

780
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:09,718
I'm the reason her husband died.

781
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,015
Also, I'm the reason my brother is dead.

782
01:05:14,899 --> 01:05:16,899
Their deaths are killing me by the day.

783
01:05:19,493 --> 01:05:20,493
I can't sleep.

784
01:05:21,603 --> 01:05:22,764
You were right.

785
01:05:23,571 --> 01:05:26,563
Velmathi is one of the reasons
why I want to go to Ceylon.

786
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,070
I reckon you're 19-years-old.

787
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,375
You have yet to live your life.

788
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:38,117
I know this gang is like your family.

789
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:40,850
But soon, these older men will die.

790
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:41,788
After that?

791
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:45,477
Go!

792
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,233
Drop everything and get married.

793
01:05:49,439 --> 01:05:50,282
Have children.

794
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,733
Be happy.

795
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:53,898
How's marriage a solution?

796
01:05:56,641 --> 01:05:58,845
I am a woman, and you're a man.
Isn't that your point?

797
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:03,780
I'm doing the dishes.

798
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,391
And you're cleaning a rifle.

799
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:08,639
I'm not a regressive man.

800
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:49,162
Eesa, we need your help.

801
01:06:50,948 --> 01:06:52,855
The Britishers stole the statue
from the temple.

802
01:06:54,463 --> 01:06:56,258
We can't lock horns with them.

803
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:00,141
I want you to steal it from them.

804
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,448
If you do it, we'll pay your price.

805
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,790
That statue is our dignity.

806
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:07,858
We need to retrieve it.

807
01:07:10,889 --> 01:07:12,928
You secured it for 600 years...

808
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,860
but now the Crown stole it from you.

809
01:07:15,776 --> 01:07:16,931
Dignity you say?

810
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,104
We'll retrieve it!

811
01:07:19,987 --> 01:07:21,639
I will plan and inform you.

812
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:23,087
Until then, live without dignity.

813
01:07:43,504 --> 01:07:44,883
They can't be trusted.

814
01:07:45,245 --> 01:07:46,502
Miller sounds like a good deal.

815
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:50,556
A few Kings are out to help us.

816
01:07:51,386 --> 01:07:54,003
A few Kings are barking
at the feet of Britishers.

817
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,707
Rajathipathi is not the barking breed...

818
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,548
but the one that bites.

819
01:08:03,238 --> 01:08:04,542
Here's the information you asked for.

820
01:08:10,006 --> 01:08:12,115
Anandha, the movement will get
a lot of funds.

821
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:14,036
Inform Vincent Pillai.

822
01:08:14,763 --> 01:08:16,004
You overlook the process.

823
01:08:16,066 --> 01:08:18,340
-Inform everyone to assemble.
-Sure!

824
01:08:20,077 --> 01:08:23,553
A convoy of five vehicles
with the Britishers and Sepoys.

825
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,943
If I'm right, the statue...

826
01:08:26,881 --> 01:08:28,723
must be in the middle vehicle.

827
01:08:29,895 --> 01:08:31,627
We don't have enough men.

828
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:33,060
Neither enough ammunition.

829
01:08:34,037 --> 01:08:34,993
What do you want from me?

830
01:08:35,428 --> 01:08:36,354
We need thirty people.

831
01:08:37,466 --> 01:08:40,276
Ten from our gang
and five from the movement.

832
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:45,845
I will send fifteen men
from my security detail.

833
01:08:47,398 --> 01:08:48,832
-You?
-No!

834
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:51,326
I'm not coming.

835
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,428
The officers know me well.

836
01:08:54,607 --> 01:08:57,040
I will send my men disguised
as village folks.

837
01:08:58,536 --> 01:09:01,245
If we get caught
it won't be good for all of us.

838
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,451
You bring me the statue!

839
01:09:04,381 --> 01:09:06,997
The King has asked me to
pay you one lakh rupees.

840
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:10,089
I will be waiting for you
with your money.

841
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:28,036
Pick the sharpest fifteen among our men.

842
01:09:28,481 --> 01:09:30,988
After the job is done,
Eesa, Kuyili, and Ayyavoo...

843
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,497
kill them all!

844
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,267
Leave no trace behind.

845
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:25,631
Why didn't your King come along?

846
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,889
He spoke too much about respect
and dignity like a jerk.

847
01:10:28,709 --> 01:10:29,763
He could've come along.

848
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:30,904
No one will notice.

849
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:32,732
Don't we wear masks during the loot?

850
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:38,353
Of course,
his life is more important to him.

851
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:43,379
Kaali, what about your life?

852
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:48,739
What if we kill you
and take away the statue?

853
01:10:54,113 --> 01:10:56,952
A hungry lion finds prey.

854
01:10:57,644 --> 01:11:01,588
But a pack of Hyenas are waiting
to steal that prey.

855
01:11:02,754 --> 01:11:06,283
In that situation,
what if a wolf takes away the prey?

856
01:11:07,425 --> 01:11:08,217
What will happen?

857
01:11:10,268 --> 01:11:13,361
The pack of Hyenas and Lion
will tag along and hunt the wolf.

858
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:19,488
For one wolf, the entire lot
will turn into prey.

859
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:18,128
Like with the Kohinoor...

860
01:12:19,574 --> 01:12:21,255
we are not stealing this stone.

861
01:12:23,254 --> 01:12:25,800
We are simply claiming
what's rightfully ours.

862
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:30,630
The most powerful empire
on the face of the earth...

863
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:32,576
has amassed unimaginable wealth.

864
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:34,732
Taking what it deserves.

865
01:12:35,458 --> 01:12:39,925
I expect our King will be rather pleased
with this fascinating little trinket.

866
01:13:50,311 --> 01:13:50,974
Oh, God!

867
01:13:56,818 --> 01:13:58,191
Dacoits!

868
01:14:44,197 --> 01:14:45,254
Fire!

869
01:15:57,404 --> 01:15:59,427
Hey, come on! Hurry up!

870
01:16:03,186 --> 01:16:04,951
-Go! Go! Go!
-Go and get the Jeep.

871
01:16:12,138 --> 01:16:13,489
Drive faster!

872
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:23,754
Hey!

873
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:29,412
Hey! Hey! Hey, drive!

874
01:17:17,462 --> 01:17:19,204
Hey, turn around the vehicle!

875
01:17:27,368 --> 01:17:28,673
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

876
01:17:30,877 --> 01:17:31,977
Hey! Hey!

877
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:33,492
Hey!

878
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:19,726
Wait...

879
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:21,499
I know who you are.

880
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:23,477
You're Miller!

881
01:20:23,797 --> 01:20:25,860
A wanted with a price on your head...

882
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:27,235
for robbery and murder.

883
01:20:27,893 --> 01:20:29,150
They'll find you, you know!

884
01:20:30,313 --> 01:20:31,688
It doesn't matter where you hide.

885
01:20:31,954 --> 01:20:33,211
They'll hunt you down!

886
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,241
But it just too happens...

887
01:20:36,928 --> 01:20:38,685
I have the power to save you.

888
01:20:40,343 --> 01:20:42,344
For I am the Governor's son!

889
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:43,851
You?

890
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,529
Governor's son, Riley?

891
01:20:48,142 --> 01:20:48,829
Yes!

892
01:20:50,228 --> 01:20:50,869
Yes!

893
01:20:51,437 --> 01:20:53,254
I'll tell you a story.

894
01:20:54,914 --> 01:20:55,617
One girl...

895
01:20:56,577 --> 01:20:58,271
saved my life twice.

896
01:21:00,303 --> 01:21:01,053
I wronged her.

897
01:21:02,345 --> 01:21:03,227
I wronged that girl.

898
01:21:05,163 --> 01:21:05,945
The girl asked me...

899
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:07,367
...for a thing.

900
01:21:08,227 --> 01:21:09,138
Should I give it to her?

901
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:12,287
Yes, of course. You must!

902
01:21:13,244 --> 01:21:14,517
Whatever she desires.

903
01:21:14,751 --> 01:21:15,709
Your death!

904
01:21:33,768 --> 01:21:34,631
Come on!

905
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:06,485
CEYLON

906
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,518
He betrayed us!

907
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:23,598
I should've told him when Kaali riddled me.

908
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,263
We are doing this for your village.

909
01:22:28,423 --> 01:22:29,434
I made a mistake.

910
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,532
The village will be destroyed!

911
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:53,621
You couldn't even complete a small job.

912
01:23:54,589 --> 01:23:57,978
Now we have to bow down to these morons.

913
01:24:00,255 --> 01:24:02,430
You should shoot yourself.

914
01:24:05,223 --> 01:24:07,902
The murder of the Governor's son
was a grave mistake.

915
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:11,426
For which those responsible
will pay dearly.

916
01:24:12,035 --> 01:24:15,152
Our Kingdom is not responsible
in any way...

917
01:24:15,576 --> 01:24:16,497
My...

918
01:24:21,204 --> 01:24:21,859
General!

919
01:24:22,804 --> 01:24:23,804
Ah, General!

920
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:28,685
It's Miller who killed Riley
and took the treasure away.

921
01:24:29,518 --> 01:24:31,155
He belongs to that village.

922
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,340
And they may know where he might be.

923
01:24:34,033 --> 01:24:37,572
There's another matter of
particular concern to The Crown.

924
01:24:41,983 --> 01:24:43,309
Before we found out about it...

925
01:24:43,801 --> 01:24:45,928
you'd been hiding from us
all the information

926
01:24:45,953 --> 01:24:48,262
about this treasure and its origins.

927
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:50,321
General it's actually--

928
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:53,155
The village and the temple will now
become British property.

929
01:24:56,056 --> 01:24:57,314
Mining will soon begin.

930
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,754
And we will find out exactly
what lies beneath.

931
01:25:25,938 --> 01:25:28,570
Ayya, please spare me.
I don't know anything.

932
01:25:28,806 --> 01:25:29,964
Please don't beat me.

933
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:32,048
Ayya, I don't know where Eesa is!

934
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,571
Please spare me.

935
01:25:33,815 --> 01:25:35,674
Oh, no! Please don't beat me.

936
01:25:35,792 --> 01:25:37,989
Ayya, please spare me.

937
01:25:40,027 --> 01:25:41,825
We don't know anything.

938
01:25:42,657 --> 01:25:45,824
-Ayya...
-We don't know where Eesa is.

939
01:25:45,986 --> 01:25:47,270
Oh, God, no!

940
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:50,098
-Hey, tell me!
-Oh, God, help us!

941
01:25:51,377 --> 01:25:52,619
Please don't beat me.

942
01:25:52,698 --> 01:25:55,208
Ayya, it's hurting.

943
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:58,517
-It's hurting.
-Oh, no!

944
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,106
We don't know anything about Eesa.

945
01:26:01,806 --> 01:26:03,497
-Oh, no!
-Where is Eesa?

946
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:14,229
Give me the cotton.

947
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,458
-My people are dying...
-Get in the front!

948
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:18,822
-I have to save them.
-Let me remove the bullet.

949
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:20,624
-Let go of me.
-Please bear with me.

950
01:26:20,854 --> 01:26:23,103
-One minute. Let me put medicine.
-I have to save my people.

951
01:26:23,268 --> 01:26:24,707
-You may go.
-I said let me go.

952
01:26:31,736 --> 01:26:33,408
Hey! Hey, hold him.

953
01:26:33,494 --> 01:26:34,580
Don't let him fall.

954
01:26:34,698 --> 01:26:36,580
Maadu! Maadu!

955
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:38,708
-Oh, no!
-It's hurting!

956
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:41,345
-Oh, God, no!
-It's hurting.

957
01:26:41,861 --> 01:26:43,658
We don't know anything.

958
01:26:45,257 --> 01:26:46,167
Tell me where he is.

959
01:26:47,401 --> 01:26:48,611
Ayya, please don't beat us.

960
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,728
Hey, sit down. I said sit down.

961
01:26:53,283 --> 01:26:54,262
Sit down.

962
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:04,572
Please don't beat me.

963
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,205
Oh, no!

964
01:27:07,282 --> 01:27:09,368
Tell me. I said tell me.

965
01:27:11,737 --> 01:27:13,028
Alright, where's Miller?

966
01:27:15,086 --> 01:27:18,450
Or Annaleesan
whatever the hell you people call him.

967
01:27:22,236 --> 01:27:23,563
Where is Annaleesan?

968
01:27:30,407 --> 01:27:31,297
Speak up!

969
01:27:32,299 --> 01:27:33,525
Where is Annaleesan?

970
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:38,402
I'm going to kill one of you...

971
01:27:39,674 --> 01:27:40,465
...every hour.

972
01:27:42,356 --> 01:27:43,704
Until someone tells me where he is.

973
01:27:43,744 --> 01:27:44,801
You all are going to die!

974
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,069
One life every hour.

975
01:27:49,837 --> 01:27:51,055
If you wish to live...

976
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,587
Tell me, where is Annaleesan?

977
01:27:59,954 --> 01:28:02,239
Alright, let's start with...

978
01:28:03,056 --> 01:28:03,618
...him!

979
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:06,494
Come!

980
01:28:09,385 --> 01:28:10,971
Ayya, please spare me.

981
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:12,660
Hey, tell me where he is.

982
01:28:15,322 --> 01:28:17,173
Hey, sit down. Sit down!

983
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:18,509
Please spare us!

984
01:28:18,775 --> 01:28:19,709
Hey, sit down!

985
01:28:20,775 --> 01:28:22,411
We don't know anything.
Please spare us!

986
01:28:29,377 --> 01:28:31,181
Ayya, I don't know anything.

987
01:28:31,494 --> 01:28:33,712
Please spare me. I have a family.

988
01:28:33,838 --> 01:28:34,494
Ayya!

989
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:37,025
Oh, no!

990
01:28:45,657 --> 01:28:46,664
Oh, no!

991
01:28:56,405 --> 01:28:58,127
Huh, this has been fun. Hasn't it?

992
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,379
It's too bloody hot, though.
I'll tell you what...

993
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:05,429
Let's make it half an hour.

994
01:29:07,899 --> 01:29:08,623
Oh, no!

995
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:12,293
Oh, no!

996
01:29:14,524 --> 01:29:15,563
The sound of the bullet...

997
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:16,985
The sound of the bullet...

998
01:29:17,555 --> 01:29:20,180
...is music to my ears.

999
01:29:23,345 --> 01:29:24,631
I'm happy!

1000
01:29:43,111 --> 01:29:44,916
Where is Annaleesan?

1001
01:29:52,251 --> 01:29:53,486
We're out of bullets, Kannaiya.

1002
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:55,877
Our men are injured!

1003
01:29:57,845 --> 01:30:00,009
There should be another way
to stop them.

1004
01:30:01,931 --> 01:30:02,704
Kannaiya!

1005
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:07,555
Don't worry about me.

1006
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:11,891
I'm scared, Kannaiya.

1007
01:30:13,548 --> 01:30:15,220
I think I'll die out here.

1008
01:30:18,009 --> 01:30:20,087
All of you leave from here.

1009
01:30:20,493 --> 01:30:21,743
You people escape from here.

1010
01:31:12,821 --> 01:31:14,715
Alright, let's not waste time. Shall we?

1011
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:21,267
The sooner you tell me.
The sooner all this bloody killing stops.

1012
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:25,141
Once he gets the money.
He wanted to go to Ceylon.

1013
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:28,337
He has to go via Dhanushkodi.

1014
01:31:30,024 --> 01:31:31,370
If you go there, you can capture him.

1015
01:31:33,415 --> 01:31:34,687
Alright, I'll stop the killing.

1016
01:31:44,611 --> 01:31:45,267
Go!

1017
01:31:55,290 --> 01:31:57,387
The fugitive is in
Dhanushkodi's old harbour.

1018
01:31:57,767 --> 01:31:58,485
I repeat.

1019
01:31:58,799 --> 01:32:00,830
The fugitive is in
Dhanushkodi's old harbour.

1020
01:32:00,969 --> 01:32:01,500
Over!

1021
01:32:28,174 --> 01:32:29,845
[Pechiamma]Many attempted to steal it.

1022
01:32:29,977 --> 01:32:30,766
But failed.

1023
01:32:32,142 --> 01:32:33,837
Hundreds of years passed...

1024
01:32:34,024 --> 01:32:37,313
neither the stone nor the temple
lost its value.

1025
01:32:37,626 --> 01:32:40,142
But the people who built the temple...

1026
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:43,291
are considered not worthy enough
to enter it.

1027
01:32:43,535 --> 01:32:45,331
Whenever injustice strikes...

1028
01:32:45,537 --> 01:32:46,801
At that time, Koranar appears...

1029
01:32:46,876 --> 01:32:49,556
and saves the people
is a belief of our people.

1030
01:32:50,646 --> 01:32:52,193
-Pechiamma.
-What?

1031
01:32:52,223 --> 01:32:53,673
We have information
that Sengannan is arriving.

1032
01:32:55,927 --> 01:32:56,746
He is coming.

1033
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:58,255
Your dear son is arriving.

1034
01:32:58,443 --> 01:33:00,240
Well, now no one can stop your atrocities.

1035
01:33:00,405 --> 01:33:02,045
Go! Go and take a shower.

1036
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,489
She's blabbering, and you're listening
to her horror stories.

1037
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:07,072
She's spinning stories.
Get up and leave!

1038
01:33:07,205 --> 01:33:08,129
Hey, get lost!

1039
01:33:08,428 --> 01:33:10,900
Koranar will appear and save the people,
it seems.

1040
01:33:21,830 --> 01:33:23,431
Why should we pray to God?

1041
01:33:23,558 --> 01:33:25,136
Anyway, we are not allowed
inside the temple.

1042
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:27,779
God did not appear out of nowhere
from the sky.

1043
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:28,459
Oh-oh!

1044
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:30,931
It's omnipresent among us.

1045
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:32,861
It's like Ayyanar and Koranar.

1046
01:33:33,116 --> 01:33:34,842
It's a tribute to them.

1047
01:33:35,192 --> 01:33:36,269
Is this the time for it?

1048
01:33:36,623 --> 01:33:39,009
The King and the Prince
are already making trouble.

1049
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:40,580
Why do we need this celebration
at the moment?

1050
01:33:40,772 --> 01:33:42,397
Ah... let them come.

1051
01:33:42,796 --> 01:33:45,140
If they come here, I'll kill them myself.

1052
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:46,819
-Yeah, right!
-My dear!

1053
01:33:47,751 --> 01:33:48,521
You're looking good!

1054
01:33:49,968 --> 01:33:52,280
Anna! Pechiamma, Sengannan is here.

1055
01:33:52,574 --> 01:33:54,127
-Come on. Off you go!
-He has arrived.

1056
01:33:56,897 --> 01:33:57,897
How are you, Anna?

1057
01:33:58,506 --> 01:34:00,747
-I'm good. How are you?
-I'm good!

1058
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:02,140
-This is for Aandiappan..
-He is here.

1059
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:06,046
-Mother.
-Welcome, my son.

1060
01:34:06,778 --> 01:34:07,912
My dear son.

1061
01:34:08,062 --> 01:34:09,921
I'm not saying
what you're doing is wrong.

1062
01:34:10,068 --> 01:34:12,891
But you're always away from home.

1063
01:34:13,061 --> 01:34:14,133
Please visit often.

1064
01:34:14,162 --> 01:34:16,819
With the universe throbbing
and earth-shaking

1065
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:19,549
Here appears Koranar!

1066
01:34:19,686 --> 01:34:22,225
Son, please put some sense
into your brother's head.

1067
01:34:22,983 --> 01:34:25,061
Ayya, Koranar!

1068
01:34:25,492 --> 01:34:27,656
-Eesa!
-Sengannan!

1069
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:29,740
Not bad you remember my name.

1070
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:31,210
Are you trying to guilt-trip me?

1071
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:35,148
I'm happy that you came home.

1072
01:34:36,099 --> 01:34:37,474
Why don't you stay back?

1073
01:34:38,301 --> 01:34:40,343
The old lady will be happy too.

1074
01:34:41,296 --> 01:34:42,694
She's not keeping well.

1075
01:34:44,748 --> 01:34:47,246
But she hides it well from everyone.

1076
01:34:48,154 --> 01:34:50,187
She's spinning horror stories
and fooling people.

1077
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,077
You forgot about family
and gave yourself to the country.

1078
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:56,928
You've grown up.

1079
01:34:57,928 --> 01:34:59,084
Of course!

1080
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:00,733
This is what happens
when you don't visit often.

1081
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:04,201
Let's go!

1082
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:05,647
Listen...

1083
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:09,147
In this old age,
the mother shares her beliefs with others.

1084
01:35:09,396 --> 01:35:10,812
Why do you want to discourage her?

1085
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:13,076
I won't discourage. Let's go!

1086
01:35:14,014 --> 01:35:16,359
-Mother will be happy.
-Fine, I'll come.

I mean, Prince!

1099
01:37:07,544 --> 01:37:11,179
Instead of celebrating with liquor
you're drowning in smoke.

1100
01:37:11,285 --> 01:37:13,359
Hey, stop ranting like a moron!

1101
01:37:14,503 --> 01:37:17,353
They came here to make a living.

1102
01:37:18,058 --> 01:37:19,809
I wanted to chase them away.

1103
01:37:20,598 --> 01:37:23,553
But now they're building a temple.

1104
01:37:23,833 --> 01:37:27,934
A good clerk understands your woes
without being told.

1105
01:37:29,019 --> 01:37:31,825
Sengolan, who is wanted
by the Britishers...

1106
01:37:32,214 --> 01:37:34,697
is going to be present
at the temple building festival.

1107
01:37:35,262 --> 01:37:36,800
I informed the Police about it.

1108
01:37:37,261 --> 01:37:38,854
Also, I sent some of our men with them.

1109
01:37:39,325 --> 01:37:41,325

Come on, run!

1127
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:16,629
Oh, God!

1128
01:39:16,897 --> 01:39:19,770
Oh, no, Amma. Pechiamma.

1129
01:39:24,473 --> 01:39:25,584
Eesa, take care of Amma.

1130
01:39:25,609 --> 01:39:27,364
You go, Anna.
I will take care of her.

1131
01:39:31,474 --> 01:39:32,215
They went this way.

1132
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:33,167
Come with me!

1133
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:50,191
Dear, I want to see my son.

1134
01:39:51,047 --> 01:39:53,687
Hey, Eesa... Sengola!

1135
01:39:54,086 --> 01:39:56,351
I want to see Sengola!

1136
01:39:56,726 --> 01:39:58,327
-My son...
-Pechiamma!

1137
01:39:58,412 --> 01:39:59,491
I want to see my son.

1138
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:01,116
I want to see my son.

1139
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,725
I want to see Eesa, too!

1140
01:40:03,100 --> 01:40:04,303
Eesa...

1141
01:40:04,554 --> 01:40:06,460
Please bring me, my son.

1142
01:40:07,138 --> 01:40:07,904
Eesa...

1143
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:08,833
Sengola!

1144
01:40:09,272 --> 01:40:10,998
Please bring me, my son.

1145
01:40:11,584 --> 01:40:13,036
Sengola...

1146
01:40:13,498 --> 01:40:16,077
-I want to see Sengola.
-Brother will be here.

1147
01:40:16,186 --> 01:40:17,029
Sengola!

1148
01:40:17,272 --> 01:40:18,389
I've sent word to him.

1149
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,129
Eesa!

1150
01:40:22,122 --> 01:40:24,045
My son... My son...

1151
01:40:26,523 --> 01:40:27,366
Sengola!

1152
01:40:27,941 --> 01:40:29,175
Sengola!

1153
01:40:32,963 --> 01:40:33,915
Sengola...

1154
01:40:34,006 --> 01:40:35,904
Pechiamma!

1155
01:40:37,506 --> 01:40:39,593
You passed on, Amma!

1156
01:40:39,625 --> 01:40:41,607
Oh, no, Pechiamma.

1157
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:43,436
Pechiamma left us.

1158
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:44,843
Oh, my God!

1159
01:40:45,084 --> 01:40:46,053
Oh, God...

1160
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:51,804
Eesa, God shows no mercy.

1161
01:40:52,335 --> 01:40:54,630
Also, our Koranar has no regard for us.

1162
01:40:55,827 --> 01:40:58,576
Your mother left you, Eesa!

1163
01:40:59,491 --> 01:41:00,983
My dear son!

1164
01:41:04,062 --> 01:41:05,898
Oh, God, no!

1165
01:41:11,382 --> 01:41:13,037
Pechiamma!

1166
01:42:03,884 --> 01:42:05,232
Why do you look like you saw a ghost?

1167
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:08,123
What did you see?

1168
01:42:12,092 --> 01:42:12,607
Step aside.

1169
01:42:14,344 --> 01:42:16,988
Miller, we received a message
from Kannaiya.

1170
01:42:17,243 --> 01:42:19,235
He needs guns and ammunition.
We are going.

1171
01:42:20,548 --> 01:42:22,035
-How could you do this, Miller?
-Manimaara...

1172
01:42:22,375 --> 01:42:23,793
-You don't know...
-Bring me the boxes.

1173
01:42:23,976 --> 01:42:25,726
the people from your village
are tied to this job.

1174
01:42:26,331 --> 01:42:28,276
When the King's men came to see you...

1175
01:42:28,329 --> 01:42:29,381
It was Ayyavoo who brought them.

1176
01:42:30,025 --> 01:42:31,142
He asked me not to tell you.

1177
01:42:31,776 --> 01:42:33,810
Because of you
the village will be destroyed.

1178
01:42:35,029 --> 01:42:38,014
When you were escaping with your beloved
during the temple carnival...

1179
01:42:38,684 --> 01:42:41,162
it was Eesa who helped you with his life.

1180
01:42:42,296 --> 01:42:43,936
I don't know what came over him...

1181
01:42:46,506 --> 01:42:48,116
This is not the Eesa I grew up with.

1182
01:43:08,435 --> 01:43:11,099
Hey! Do you recognize him?

1183
01:43:12,287 --> 01:43:13,857
He was here...

1184
01:43:14,957 --> 01:43:16,717
The name of the place...

1185
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:19,051
The name of the place...

1186
01:43:19,842 --> 01:43:21,303
It's at the tip of my tongue.

1187
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:23,983
The name of the place...

1188
01:43:24,716 --> 01:43:26,593
It was a nice name!

1189
01:43:30,687 --> 01:43:32,819
Ceylon! He went to Ceylon!

1190
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:45,647
The fugitive has escaped.

1191
01:43:45,875 --> 01:43:48,216
I repeat, the fugitive has escaped.

1192
01:43:48,517 --> 01:43:50,311
-Over!
-Copy! Over and out!

1193
01:43:58,384 --> 01:44:00,366
-Sir...
-So he has escaped. Has he?

1194
01:44:00,562 --> 01:44:01,210
Yes sir!

1195
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,211

Come on!

1256
01:50:15,827 --> 01:50:16,850
Keep the guns over there.

1257
01:50:18,002 --> 01:50:19,377
Bring out the bullet boxes one by one.

1258
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:27,396
Where is Kanagasabai?

1259
01:51:27,529 --> 01:51:28,779
The pigs caught him!

1260
01:51:28,913 --> 01:51:31,420
Aren't you ashamed to say this?

1261
01:51:31,879 --> 01:51:34,050
I don't know why I am raising you all
for no good.

1262
01:51:56,916 --> 01:51:58,748
Just like we killed her father...

1263
01:51:59,513 --> 01:52:01,264
I will kill the wretch, too.

1264
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:25,383
Our men...

1265
01:53:30,010 --> 01:53:30,672
Go!

1266
01:53:45,515 --> 01:53:46,851
You're trying to scare us?

1267
01:53:49,576 --> 01:53:50,967
You listen to me, Miller!

1268
01:53:52,500 --> 01:53:55,189
Lay down your weapons.
We'd like a peaceful surrender.

1269
01:53:55,812 --> 01:53:56,734
And if you don't...

1270
01:53:57,350 --> 01:54:00,292
General Wandy will come
with a huge fleet of 700 men.

1271
01:54:01,297 --> 01:54:03,609
And you won't stand a chance.

1272
01:54:04,484 --> 01:54:05,468
I'm warning you, Miller.

1273
01:54:06,257 --> 01:54:09,098
Surrender yourself now.

1274
01:54:13,608 --> 01:54:14,286
You...

1275
01:54:15,116 --> 01:54:15,920
believe...

1276
01:54:16,437 --> 01:54:17,116
...in Devil?

1277
01:54:20,919 --> 01:54:22,540
I am the Devil!

1278
01:54:23,631 --> 01:54:25,475
And you will call me...

1279
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,963
Captain Miller!

1280
01:54:30,156 --> 01:54:31,577
No! Miller no!

1281
01:54:31,907 --> 01:54:32,618
No!

1282
01:54:32,889 --> 01:54:33,779
No!

1283
01:55:11,086 --> 01:55:12,585
Where are the Sepoys?

1284
01:55:13,391 --> 01:55:14,531
They are 100 miles away...

1285
01:55:15,181 --> 01:55:16,422
in Veeravanallur.

1286
01:55:17,500 --> 01:55:19,122
You have insulted Andrew Wandy.

1287
01:55:22,516 --> 01:55:24,028
Not just to capture you...

1288
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:27,200
but to destroy the entire village
he'll come with 700 sepoys.

1289
01:55:41,234 --> 01:55:43,234
As far as he's here
we will keep getting into trouble.

1290
01:55:45,125 --> 01:55:46,414
They came looking for him.

1291
01:55:48,374 --> 01:55:49,422
He has to surrender himself.

1292
01:55:49,547 --> 01:55:51,742
Hey! If he surrenders?

1293
01:55:52,428 --> 01:55:53,834
Didn't you hear what the Sepoy said?

1294
01:55:54,727 --> 01:55:57,492
They're not coming here just for Eesa.

1295
01:55:59,032 --> 01:56:01,492
But they're following the King's orders
to destroy us.

1296
01:56:04,742 --> 01:56:06,429
It's not safe for the villagers
to stay here.

1297
01:56:07,427 --> 01:56:08,802
We need to move them elsewhere.

1298
01:56:09,436 --> 01:56:12,490
Ayya, why should we leave town?

1299
01:56:12,641 --> 01:56:14,672
If we step out of this place...

1300
01:56:15,078 --> 01:56:17,273
that Rajathipathi will acquire
the entire place.

1301
01:56:18,446 --> 01:56:19,750
We were born here.

1302
01:56:20,217 --> 01:56:21,272
We lived here.

1303
01:56:21,756 --> 01:56:23,389
And our deaths will be on this soil.

1304
01:56:33,319 --> 01:56:34,866
Ayya, he's missing!

1305
01:57:12,257 --> 01:57:14,257
Was it you who killed General Buller?

1306
01:57:16,413 --> 01:57:18,914
Do you know what Captain Rafi
told us about you?

1307
01:57:19,585 --> 01:57:20,592
You were the first to

1308
01:57:20,647 --> 01:57:22,462
stand up against it and have
the courage to leave the military.

1309
01:58:00,444 --> 01:58:03,146
You take our men outside
and stand guard.

1310
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:05,553
I shall go, too.

1311
01:58:07,162 --> 01:58:08,357
I can't trust them.

1312
01:58:09,069 --> 01:58:10,217
When I get an opportunity...

1313
01:58:10,928 --> 01:58:12,746
I will kill him with my own hands.

1314
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,685
Please hear me out.

1315
01:58:33,303 --> 01:58:36,021
I understand how you
and the villagers feel.

1316
01:58:36,209 --> 01:58:37,794
But we need a place to stay.

1317
01:58:39,023 --> 01:58:40,366
The huts are all burned down.

1318
01:58:41,326 --> 01:58:42,678
Everyone is hungry.

1319
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:43,835
There are no medicines.

1320
01:58:45,093 --> 01:58:47,093
What will we do if the Britishers return?

1321
01:58:47,373 --> 01:58:49,193
We need a safe place for the people.

1322
01:58:49,374 --> 01:58:50,421
Make arrangements.

1323
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:06,114
There's a secret door behind the temple.

1324
01:59:06,687 --> 01:59:08,687
I can access that door and open it.

1325
01:59:09,242 --> 01:59:12,101
But someone has to distract the men
guarding in the front.

1326
01:59:13,876 --> 01:59:17,539
I will take the people of the movement
and your men inside.

1327
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,086
I will prepare our men.

1328
01:59:29,751 --> 01:59:32,373
Last time when you were in the temple,
they tried to kill you.

1329
01:59:35,694 --> 01:59:37,107
I'll send Thenpasiyar along with you.

1330
01:59:37,929 --> 01:59:39,631
I've faced the unthinkable.

1331
01:59:41,919 --> 01:59:44,162
I learned how to survive and escape.

1332
01:59:46,063 --> 01:59:47,305
I'm not stopping you.

1333
01:59:50,376 --> 01:59:51,616
You don't have to enter first.

1334
01:59:52,752 --> 01:59:55,241
If you're feeling guilty
I'll suggest a way to overcome it.

1335
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:59,693
It's not just your sin to bear.
Many have the right over it.

1336
02:00:00,978 --> 02:00:02,642
You cannot do anything about it.

1337
02:00:05,033 --> 02:00:07,400
You were in the group
that shot down my husband.

1338
02:00:08,065 --> 02:00:10,220
I don't believe that your bullet
killed him.

1339
02:01:02,221 --> 02:01:02,799
This is it!

1340
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:05,326
Up! We have to climb up.

1341
02:02:09,452 --> 02:02:11,151
I have something you want.

1342
02:02:11,592 --> 02:02:13,585
But in return, we need one favour.

1343
02:02:14,378 --> 02:02:15,021
What?

1344
02:02:24,846 --> 02:02:26,249
Hey, check who's out there.

1345
02:02:28,284 --> 02:02:30,600
It would help if you allowed my people
inside the temple to get to safety.

1346
02:02:32,067 --> 02:02:35,335
You can step inside the temple
only over my dead body.

1347
02:02:50,418 --> 02:02:51,307
Fire!

1348
02:03:44,548 --> 02:03:45,066
Hey!

1349
02:05:01,276 --> 02:05:03,447
I'm not avenging my father's death.

1350
02:05:04,901 --> 02:05:07,629
If I don't kill you.
You'll destroy this village.

1351
02:05:54,751 --> 02:05:55,517
Kaali!

1352
02:07:39,728 --> 02:07:40,931
Are you resenting?

1353
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:48,614
Die with resentment!

1354
02:09:15,487 --> 02:09:18,690
Eesa, are we allowed near God?

1355
02:09:21,149 --> 02:09:23,161
No God has mentioned
that you can not.

1356
02:10:04,242 --> 02:10:05,445
I need your help.

1357
02:10:06,063 --> 02:10:07,085
Also, I need your men.

1358
02:10:12,552 --> 02:10:15,337
Finally, the statue is out.

1359
02:10:17,094 --> 02:10:18,908
Everyone must be eyeing the statue.

1360
02:10:20,415 --> 02:10:23,091
The man from Andaman
must be on his way.

1361
02:10:23,741 --> 02:10:24,444
What is it?

1362
02:11:28,978 --> 02:11:29,978
What happened?

1363
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:32,736
Our soldiers have been captured
and held hostage.

1364
02:11:39,172 --> 02:11:40,164
Well, move it!

1365
02:11:42,218 --> 02:11:43,946
Come on, faster boys!

1366
02:11:46,143 --> 02:11:47,384
Faster dammit!

1367
02:12:25,243 --> 02:12:27,204
Why are you here?
Go to the temple.

1368
02:12:33,873 --> 02:12:35,441
Kannaiya didn't raise me this way.

1369
02:13:00,425 --> 02:13:02,425

Hey!

1408
02:19:05,071 --> 02:19:07,499
Do you know what Captain Rafi
told us about you?

1409
02:19:41,712 --> 02:19:44,539
-Hey, get him to safety.
-Come on, run!

1410
02:19:56,134 --> 02:19:57,047
Go!

1411
02:19:59,672 --> 02:20:01,265
Get away from here!

1412
02:20:03,930 --> 02:20:04,930
Go away!

1413
02:21:21,954 --> 02:21:24,149
FIRE!

1414
02:21:52,061 --> 02:21:53,631
-Go inside!
-Everyone go inside.

1415
02:21:53,686 --> 02:21:55,560
-Everyone get inside.
-Go inside.

1416
02:22:02,434 --> 02:22:03,508
Drag him inside.

1417
02:22:40,816 --> 02:22:41,582
Sengola!

1418
02:22:44,102 --> 02:22:45,682
It's time you come out of hiding.

1419
02:22:45,806 --> 02:22:48,500
They are going to burn down
Mathalamparai.

1420
02:27:13,300 --> 02:27:15,675
A brave warrior should listen
to his heart.

1421
02:27:41,449 --> 02:27:42,863
The price on my head is 10,000 rupees.

1422
02:27:43,580 --> 02:27:44,955
I wonder how much is the price
on your head.

1423
02:27:47,932 --> 02:27:49,402
The price does not matter to me.

1424
02:27:50,447 --> 02:27:52,878
I'm worried about how they will
sketch my face on the poster.

1425
02:28:01,862 --> 02:28:02,908
For Sembattai!

1426
02:28:08,798 --> 02:28:10,508
We listened to what the heart
had to say, Eesa.

1427
02:28:13,775 --> 02:28:15,014
But we locked horns with the devil.

1428
02:28:17,423 --> 02:28:18,383
They won't spare us!

1429
02:28:48,619 --> 02:28:50,993
You said I don't have the right to
speak about mother.

1430
02:28:52,439 --> 02:28:56,438
Since then, I've been experiencing
a severe pain, Eesa!

1431
02:28:58,298 --> 02:28:59,969
Just because I came to the festival...

1432
02:29:00,494 --> 02:29:02,141
the guilty pain of our mother's demise.

1433
02:29:04,110 --> 02:29:05,508
Whenever I arrive...

1434
02:29:06,464 --> 02:29:08,534
the pain I bring along with me.

1435
02:29:10,251 --> 02:29:11,586
Also, the pain...

1436
02:29:12,798 --> 02:29:15,251
that I cannot keep our mother
and this village happy.

1437
02:29:20,010 --> 02:29:21,626
Sengannan, please forget about it.

1438
02:29:27,674 --> 02:29:30,525
After 600 years, our people
have stepped inside the temple.

1439
02:29:32,602 --> 02:29:34,088
Isn't that what mother wanted too?

1440
02:30:03,907 --> 02:30:07,283
Ayya, Koranar Ayya...

1441
02:30:08,193 --> 02:30:11,641
Our ancestors made a figurine of Koranar
with the Gemstone...

1442
02:30:11,821 --> 02:30:13,438
and gifted it to the King.

1443
02:30:13,602 --> 02:30:18,125
They say that the gemstone is still
hidden somewhere within the Kingdom.

1444
02:30:18,258 --> 02:30:20,860
Ayya, Koranar Ayya!

1445
02:30:22,930 --> 02:30:24,120
Koranar Ayya!

1446
02:30:24,185 --> 02:30:27,500
-Ayya! Koranar Ayya!
-Please save us.

1447
02:30:33,022 --> 02:30:36,961
Have you taken the form of Eesan
to come and save us all?

1448
02:30:44,572 --> 02:30:47,267
With the universe throbbing
and earth-shaking...

1449
02:30:47,329 --> 02:30:50,234
Here appears Koranar!

1450
02:30:50,836 --> 02:30:53,359
They may believe it's a lie

1451
02:30:53,591 --> 02:30:56,356
But stories say otherwise

1452
02:30:56,748 --> 02:30:59,144
Brave Koranar will shine light on us

1453
02:30:59,255 --> 02:31:03,405
That will fetch us a permanent victory
against the enemy

1454
02:31:03,906 --> 02:31:07,023
Ayya, Koranar Ayya!

1455
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:11,368
You're the guardian of my clan.

1456
02:31:12,446 --> 02:31:18,189
For generations, we longed
to see you at least once.

1457
02:31:19,215 --> 02:31:21,761
To save this village and its people...

1458
02:31:21,818 --> 02:31:25,680
you took the form of Annaleesan.

1459
02:32:10,465 --> 02:32:11,379
Who killed him?

1460
02:32:12,503 --> 02:32:14,855
Young Princess Velmathi...

1461
02:32:16,112 --> 02:32:18,034
She joined hands with the village folks...

1462
02:32:18,939 --> 02:32:21,329
then killed our King and the Prince.

1463
02:32:23,190 --> 02:32:24,292
I could not believe it.

1464
02:32:26,681 --> 02:32:29,025
Betrayal! Betrayal!

1465
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:45,183
Does Kandhiya know about it?

1466
02:32:45,666 --> 02:32:47,010
